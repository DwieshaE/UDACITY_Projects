This dataset contains various information regarding medicals appointments of individuals living in Brazil. It includes features suchs as appointment date, age, gender, comorbidities, hospital location, appointment status, and others.

The objective of this analysis is to explore the relationships of different variables with appointment status (i.e., show vs no_showed). Appointment status is a categorical variable named as "No_Show", where 1 represents not showing up for an appointment and 0 represents a kept appointment in the dataset.

We will try to explore the impact of age on the frequency of appointment status. Next, we will explore if receiving a SMS notifcation influence appointment status and whether the length of time between the scheduled date and appointment date have an impact of appointment status. Lastly, we will identify if individuals with comorbidity (Hypertension and diabetes) will have an higher frequency of missed appointments compared to those without.
